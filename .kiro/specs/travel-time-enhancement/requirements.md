# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines enhancements to the existing Travel Time Logger Flutter application. The current app allows users to log travel entries but lacks integration between the locations management feature and the main logging functionality. This enhancement will improve user experience by integrating saved locations, adding navigation, improving the UI, and adding new productivity features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Navigation Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily navigate between different screens in the app, so that I can access all features seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a main screen with navigation options
2. WHEN a user taps on "Manage Locations" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the locations management screen
3. WHEN a user is on the locations screen THEN the system SHALL provide a way to return to the main screen
4. WHEN a user taps the back button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the previous screen

### Requirement 2: Location Integration in Travel Logging

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from my saved locations when logging travel time, so that I don't have to type addresses repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps on the departure field THEN the system SHALL show an option to select from saved locations or enter manually
2. WHEN a user taps on the arrival field THEN the system SHALL show an option to select from saved locations or enter manually
3. WHEN a user selects a saved location THEN the system SHALL populate the field with the location's full address
4. WHEN no saved locations exist THEN the system SHALL only show manual entry option
5. WHEN a user enters a new location manually THEN the system SHALL offer to save it for future use

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Data Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit and delete my travel entries, so that I can correct mistakes and manage my data effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user long-presses on a travel entry THEN the system SHALL show edit and delete options
2. WHEN a user selects edit THEN the system SHALL open the entry in an editable form
3. WHEN a user saves edited entry THEN the system SHALL update the stored data and refresh the list
4. WHEN a user selects delete THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before removing the entry
5. WHEN a user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the entry and update the list

### Requirement 4: Data Export and Reporting

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my travel data, so that I can use it for expense reports or record keeping.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the export feature THEN the system SHALL provide options for date range selection
2. WHEN a user selects a date range THEN the system SHALL generate a summary of travel entries
3. WHEN export is requested THEN the system SHALL create a CSV file with all travel data
4. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL allow the user to share or save the file
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL calculate total time and provide summary statistics

### Requirement 5: Improved User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern and intuitive interface, so that the app is pleasant and efficient to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a Material Design 3 compliant interface
2. WHEN viewing travel entries THEN the system SHALL show data in an organized, scannable format
3. WHEN using forms THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation feedback and helpful hints
4. WHEN the system is in different states THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading, empty, and error states
5. WHEN using the app THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark themes

### Requirement 6: Quick Entry Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want quick ways to log common trips, so that I can save time when entering frequent routes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has logged similar trips THEN the system SHALL suggest recent route combinations
2. WHEN a user starts typing a location THEN the system SHALL show autocomplete suggestions from saved locations
3. WHEN a user selects a suggested route THEN the system SHALL pre-fill the form with previous trip data
4. WHEN logging a return trip THEN the system SHALL offer to swap departure and arrival locations
5. WHEN creating a new entry THEN the system SHALL default the date to today

### Requirement 7: Data Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully and validate my input, so that my data is accurate and the app is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters invalid data THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages
2. WHEN the app encounters storage errors THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide recovery options
3. WHEN required fields are empty THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission and highlight missing fields
4. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity and handle any corruption gracefully
5. WHEN network operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide offline functionality and sync when available

### Requirement 8: Search and Filter Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and filter my travel entries, so that I can quickly find specific trips or analyze patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the search feature THEN the system SHALL provide a search input field
2. WHEN a user types in search THEN the system SHALL filter entries by location names, dates, or info text
3. WHEN a user applies date filters THEN the system SHALL show only entries within the selected date range
4. WHEN a user applies location filters THEN the system SHALL show only entries involving specific locations
5. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the current filter state and allow easy clearing

### Requirement 9: Multi-Segment Journey Entry

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log complex journeys with multiple stops in one form, so that I can efficiently record trips that involve several locations without creating multiple separate entries manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the quick entry form THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add multiple travel segments
2. WHEN a user adds a travel segment THEN the system SHALL allow them to add another segment with the previous arrival location as the new departure location
3. WHEN a user enters multiple segments THEN the system SHALL display all segments in a clear, organized manner within the same form
4. WHEN a user submits a multi-segment journey THEN the system SHALL create separate travel entries for each segment while maintaining the connection between them
5. WHEN a user removes a segment THEN the system SHALL update the form to maintain logical flow between remaining segments
6. WHEN viewing multi-segment entries THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators that entries are part of the same journey
7. WHEN a user edits a multi-segment journey THEN the system SHALL allow editing individual segments or the entire journey as a group
