## Details

Double-check investigation for Overview vs Trends mismatch (Jan/Feb).

Findings
- Current Trends code in repo uses minute-based values (int minutes) for monthly/daily/weekly totals.
- Current Trends UI uses `formatMinutes(...)` for user-facing labels (no decimal-hour or rounded-hour display).
- Current ReportsScreen wiring passes selected range into Trends via TimeRange and updates viewmodel date range.

Why screenshot still looks mismatched
- Screenshot values in Trends (e.g., 9h vs Overview 8h 30m, 184h vs 183h 30m, daily 7.8h) match old rounded/decimal Trends UI behavior from before latest fixes.
- This indicates app is likely running stale web build/hot-reload state rather than latest code path.

What to verify now
- Stop running app completely.
- Run `flutter run -d chrome` from `apps/mobile_flutter`.
- Hard refresh browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) to bypass cached Flutter web JS.
- Re-open Reports > Trends for same selected range and compare:
  - Monthly values should render in `Hh Mm` and match Overview minutes exactly.

Files checked
