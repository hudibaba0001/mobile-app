## Details

Fixed Home screen recent entries not appearing by removing startup blocking/race conditions in UnifiedHomeScreen.

Root cause:
- Home startup could skip or delay entry loading and recent-list population due conditional loading and awaited tracking-start initialization.
- Recent entries rendering was blocked behind startup tasks that are not required for showing recent work/travel list.

Code changes:
- File: lib/screens/unified_home_screen.dart
1) initState startup callback:
   - Removed awaited sequential startup chain.
   - Always trigger `entryProvider.loadEntries()` (safe because EntryProvider deduplicates in-flight loads).
   - Start `absenceProvider.loadAbsences(currentYear)` in parallel.
   - Call `_ensureTrackingStartDateInitialized()` without awaiting.
   - Keep `_loadRecentEntries()` immediate.
2) tracking-start initialization helper:
   - Changed guard from `if (!entryProvider.isLoading && entryProvider.entries.isEmpty)`
     to `if (entryProvider.entries.isEmpty)` so Home waits for/starts load when needed.

Verification:
- flutter analyze lib/screens/unified_home_screen.dart => PASS
- flutter analyze => PASS
- flutter test test/widgets/tracking_range_text_test.dart test/widgets/flexsaldo_card_test.dart => PASS
- flutter test => PASS

Behavior outcome:
- Home recent entries now load immediately from provider state and refresh when entries/absences finish loading.
- No business logic formulas were changed.
