## Details

Adjusted Trends monthly comparison typography/spacing to look cleaner and use standard theme sizing.

Changes made
- File: lib/screens/reports/trends_tab.dart
- In monthly comparison row (`_buildMonthlyBreakdownCard`):
  - Introduced shared theme-driven styles:
    - `metricValueStyle` based on `theme.textTheme.bodySmall`
    - `metricLabelStyle` based on `theme.textTheme.labelSmall`
  - Applied value style to Work/Travel/Total/Target and diff value.
  - Added `SizedBox(height: AppSpacing.xs)` between each numeric value and its label for better visual spacing.
  - Kept all spacing tokens from `AppSpacing` (no hardcoded padding values introduced).

Result
- Numeric hour/minute text appears less visually heavy.
- Clear spacing between the number line and the label line.
- Typography now aligns with standard theme text sizes.

Validation
- dart analyze lib/screens/reports/trends_tab.dart
- flutter test test/viewmodels/customer_analytics_viewmodel_test.dart
- Both passed.
