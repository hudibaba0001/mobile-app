# Task Logging Setup

- Number: 1
- Created: 2026-02-19T14:13:58.374244
- File: `1.md`

## Details

Request
- Create a folder inside apps/mobile_flutter for detailed task logs.
- Every completed task should be written to a new file with numeric naming.
- Naming must always continue from the latest file number (1, 2, 3, ...).

Implementation
- Added script: tool/add_task_report.dart.
- Script creates task_reports folder automatically if missing.
- Script scans task_reports for numeric filenames, finds max, and creates next file as N.md.
- Script supports:
  - --title "..." for heading.
  - --details "..." for inline details.
  - stdin details via pipe for multi-line logs.
- Script writes metadata (number, timestamp, filename) and full details block.

Usage
- With inline details:
  dart run tool/add_task_report.dart --title "My Task" --details "Detailed notes"
- With full multi-line details:
  @'...full details...'@ | dart run tool/add_task_report.dart --title "My Task"

Notes
- Numeric sequence is based on existing numeric filenames only.
- Non-numeric files in task_reports are ignored.
