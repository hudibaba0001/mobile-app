## Details

Fixed Android debug build failure caused by unsupported flutter_animate API usage in SplashScreen.

Changes:
- File: lib/screens/splash_screen.dart
- Replaced unsupported `.typewriter(...)` animation chain on the KvikTime title with supported effects:
  - `.fadeIn(duration: 900.ms, curve: Curves.easeOut)`
  - `.slideY(begin: 0.12, end: 0, duration: 900.ms)`

Why:
- Package version flutter_animate 4.5.2 does not provide `typewriter` extension on `Animate`, which caused compile failure.

Verification:
- flutter analyze lib/screens/splash_screen.dart => PASS
- Build blocker error `The method 'typewriter' isn't defined for the class 'Animate'` is removed.
