## Details

Made CI green by resolving pre-existing unrelated analyzer/test issues without changing business logic.

Actions completed:
1) Fixed fatal analyze warnings
- lib/main.dart
  - Removed duplicate import of user_red_day_adapter.
- lib/screens/login_screen.dart
  - Removed unused google_fonts import.

2) Verified failing tests root causes are resolved in current codebase
- test/services/csv_exporter_test.dart now matches CsvExporter section-header behavior (Data header)
- test/widgets/time_balance_dashboard_test.dart uses minute-based constructor and Hh Mm expectations
- test/admin/admin_users_screen_test.dart is an explicit skipped placeholder because AdminUsersScreen no longer exists in lib/screens

Verification run:
- flutter test => PASS (all tests passed, 1 intentionally skipped placeholder test)
- flutter analyze => PASS (No issues found)
