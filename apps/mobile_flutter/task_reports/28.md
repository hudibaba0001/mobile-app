## Details

Fixed Home recent entries layout crash after data load.

Observed from logs:
- Data path is healthy: 66 entries loaded, "Recent entries composed: 10".
- Crash is UI layout: sliver child assertions (`child.hasSize`, `!_debugDoingThisLayout`).

Root cause:
- Timeline item used `Expanded` inside a `Column` that can receive unbounded height in sliver context.

Fix:
- File: lib/screens/unified_home_screen.dart
- Refactored `_buildRecentEntryTimelineItem(...)`:
  - Removed left-side `Column` with `Expanded` connector.
  - Replaced with `Stack + Positioned` vertical connector line.
  - Kept row content and spacing behavior intact.

Verification:
- flutter analyze lib/screens/unified_home_screen.dart => PASS
- flutter test test/widgets/flexsaldo_card_test.dart test/widgets/tracking_range_text_test.dart => PASS

Expected outcome:
- Home recent entries render without sliver layout assertions while still showing the latest loaded entries.
