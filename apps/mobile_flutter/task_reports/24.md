## Details

Follow-up cleanup after CI-green pass.

Changes:
1) Updated skipped admin test TODO wording to include explicit condition:
   - Unskip when AdminUsersScreen is reintroduced, or remove test entirely.
   File: test/admin/admin_users_screen_test.dart

2) Removed stray Windows artifact file `nul` from repo root.
   - `git clean` could not remove due reserved-name permission behavior on Windows.
   - Removed safely via extended path deletion:
     cmd /c del "\\?\c:\Users\sanlo\Documents\GitHub\mobile-app\nul"

Verification:
- git status now shows only expected modified test file.
- flutter test test/admin/admin_users_screen_test.dart => skipped placeholder test as expected.
