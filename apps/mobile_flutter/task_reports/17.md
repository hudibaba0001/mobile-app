## Details

Updated export output with two UX consistency improvements:

1) Report-sheet totals note:
- Kept totals row name as `TOTAL (tracked only)`.
- Added a note row at top of Report sheet:
  - `TOTAL (tracked only) excludes Leave and Balance events. See Summary (Easy).`
- Note is stored in fixed 20-column schema without changing column order.

2) Swedish Summary labels for cleaner-facing exports:
- Added locale-aware labels in `OverviewTab._reportExportLabels(...)`.
- If locale is Swedish (`sv`), Summary labels now use:
  - Totalt loggad tid
  - Betald fr?nvaro
  - Tid som r?knas
  - Planerad tid
  - Skillnad mot plan
  - Din saldo efter perioden
- English labels remain for non-Swedish locales.

Technical changes:
- Extended `ReportExportLabels` with `trackedTotalsNote`.
- ExportService now inserts a `NOTE` row in Report sheet using this label.
- Updated tests to assert note row content and preserve existing tracked-only totals behavior.

Validation:
- `flutter test test/services/export_service_test.dart`
- `flutter analyze lib/services/export_service.dart lib/screens/reports/overview_tab.dart test/services/export_service_test.dart`
- All passed.
