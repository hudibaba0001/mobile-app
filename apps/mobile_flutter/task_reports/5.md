## Details

Fix applied for missing January in Trends monthly list.

Issue
- Trends monthly section filtered out month buckets with 0 tracked minutes and no leave events.
- This caused January to disappear when February had data and January had zero (or travel disabled), resulting in only February being shown.

Change made
- In `lib/screens/reports/trends_tab.dart`, monthly list now uses all buckets returned by `viewModel.monthlyBreakdown` for the selected range.
- Removed zero-filtering step so months in range are always displayed.

File updated
- lib/screens/reports/trends_tab.dart
  - `visibleMonths` now set directly from `monthlyBreakdown`.

Validation
- `dart analyze lib/screens/reports/trends_tab.dart` passed.

Expected result
- If selected range includes Jan and Feb, both months are shown in Trends monthly section.
