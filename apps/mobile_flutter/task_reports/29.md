## Details

Fixed duplicate arrow in Home recent entries header "View All" action.

Issue:
- Label used localized string with embedded arrow (`home_viewAllArrow`: "View All ?")
- UI also rendered trailing arrow icon (`Icons.arrow_forward_rounded`)
- Result: visual double arrow.

Change:
- File: lib/screens/unified_home_screen.dart
- Switched action text from `t.home_viewAllArrow` to `t.home_viewAll`.
- Kept existing icon for consistent button affordance.

Verification:
- flutter analyze lib/screens/unified_home_screen.dart => PASS
