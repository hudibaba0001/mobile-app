# Product Guidelines

## Tone of Voice
Direct, calm, and trust-building (not “friendly” or “chatty”). Short Swedish-style plain language. Focus on clarity and payroll accuracy. No guilt/productivity language. Use neutral wording like “Worked”, “Credited”, “Target”, “Variance”, “Export report”. Errors should explain what happened and what to do next in one sentence. Confirmation messages should be minimal (“Saved”, “Export ready”).

## Visual Identity
Minimalist + Professional, dark-first. Clean, modern UI with strong contrast and large tap targets for field workers. Use a restrained palette (one primary accent + neutrals), consistent spacing, and a single typography system across the app. Prioritize one “headline number” per card (e.g., Month saldo) with supporting lines beneath. Charts are secondary and optional; tables/rows should be readable and scannable. Avoid flashy gradients/animations; keep it fast and trustworthy.

## Brand Messaging
- **Primary tagline (short):** “Din tid. Dina siffror.” (Your time. Your numbers.)
- **Supporting line (explainer):** “Räkna ut saldo mot ditt arbetstidsmål och exportera underlag till lön—inkl. restid och frånvaro.” (Calculate balance against your work time goal and export documentation to payroll—incl. travel time and absence.)
- **In-app promise (one sentence):** “Logga snabbt, se plus/minus, exportera rapport.” (Log quickly, see plus/minus, export report.)

## Localization and Cultural Considerations
- **Swedish employment terms:** Use standard Swedish workplace terminology and abbreviations: VAB, sjuk, semester, flextid/flexsaldo, OB, “röda dagar”, “arbetstid”, “restid”, “tillgodoräknat”, “avvikelse”. Avoid “productivity” wording.
- **Holiday logic:** Use Sweden public holidays (“röda dagar”) and support employer-specific variants (e.g., “afton” rules) as simple toggles/presets.
- **Payroll expectations:** Reports should match how Swedish employers/payroll think: totals in minutes/hours, clear date ranges, and explicit “Auto vs Manuell” travel.
- **Privacy/GDPR:** Be explicit that no background tracking occurs; store only what’s needed; provide Terms/Privacy links in-app; allow data export/delete request flow (even if handled on web).
- **Formatting:** Swedish date/time formats (YYYY-MM-DD or Swedish locale), decimal comma for hours if you show decimals, and SEK for pricing references (mostly on web).
